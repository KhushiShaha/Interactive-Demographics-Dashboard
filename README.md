## 🧩 Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
- Performed initial data formatting and validation in **Excel** to ensure consistency.
- Used **Python (pandas)** for deeper cleaning — handling missing values, normalizing city/state names, and structuring latitude-longitude data.
- Exported the cleaned dataset as a CSV for database integration.

### 2. **Database Management**
- Loaded the cleaned dataset into **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
- Created and executed SQL queries to verify data integrity and prepare it for visualization.
- Configured the database for remote connection with Looker Studio.

### 3. **Visualization in Looker Studio**
- Connected SSMS to **Looker Studio** for live data visualization.
- Built a **Bubble Map** to represent city-wise or region-wise insights using geographic fields.
- Added **interactive filters** (Gender, Age Range, State) to enable user-driven exploration.
- Configured **tooltips, bubble sizes, and color dimensions** for better readability and analysis.
- Designed a clean, user-friendly dashboard layout for intuitive navigation.
